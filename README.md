## About

This is a Ruby on Rails project put together on a bootcamp hackathon. Our idea was to build a simple app that helps teachers manage their students. It's fairly rudimental, but it worked - and at the end of the day got us the hackathon win.

During this project we learned to set up our very own application from 0 to MVP, as well as work as a team.

## Running the application

Should be fairly straightforward:

1. Clone or download the repo

2. Run bundle install

3. Run rails db:migrate

4. Run rails server

5. Browse to http://localhost:3000
